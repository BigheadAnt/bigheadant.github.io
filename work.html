        <h2>
            Mary had a Little Lamb
        </h2>
        <h4>by Owen Le</h4>

        <p>
            It is a well known fact that there was once a young girl named Mary who had in her possession a small white sheep. The story, spread in the form of a rather catchy little ditty, depicts Mary having a little lamb which would follow her relentlessly, finding her no matter where she went. This was fine, until one day the small sheep broke into Mary’s school and was quickly removed and permanently banned from the property. That is where the story abruptly, almost ominously, ends. This begs the question, what happened to Mary and the little lamb? Where are they now? How, in fact, did Mary come into possession of this diminutive sheep in the first place? As it turns out, the story is far more twisted and sinister than the children’s ditty would lead one to believe. Today, you will finally know, at last, the true story of Mary and the little lamb.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our story begins one early summer in England. To the pleasure of many farmers, the yearly litters of lamb were finally beginning to be birthed. One sheep farmer in particular was especially pleased at the arrival of new life, albeit for a drastically different reason than one may expect. Although sheep can be slaughtered at any time of year, this farmer found that slaughtering them during birthing season was much more profitable than doing it at any other time of year. More precisely, the farmer found it quite profitable to slaughter ewes at the very moment they were giving birth. This seemingly grisly practice, he often claimed, was actually far less cruel than standard slaughtering procedure. The pain of being slit through the neck is largely eclipsed by the pain of having a small mammal lodged in the vaginal canal, the farmer reasoned, so a knife through the jugular would go largely unnoticed by the birthing ewe.

        <p>
            Now, you, the reader, may be beginning to wonder how this wonderfully merciful killing method would help the farmer financially whatsoever. This was a question that the farmer himself had no idea how to answer; he had simply noticed that a few years after he adopted this practice, his wool sales began to grow tremendously. As it turns out, the explanation for this strange phenomenon is quite simple and obvious in hindsight. Lambs, like most other mammals, subside on mother’s milk during their early development. However, there was no sheep’s milk to be had since the farmer had neglected this fact and slaughtered all of the birthing mothers. This left the newborn sheep with very little time to gather themselves before they all starved to death, and in their desperation, they banded together under the biggest, baddest lamb to try and find milk. The biggest, baddest lamb, of course, came to the conclusion that they must take another mammal mother by force, so the band of sheep stormed a nearby pig farm and managed to enslave one of the weaker sows. With their newfound source of milk, the lambs were able to sustain themselves and gain strength.

            Soon enough, one lamb obviously had the idea that they should try and subjugate every single farm in their vicinity. The other sheep thought that this was a terrific idea, and the nearby pig, chicken, and duck farms quickly found themselves in a vicious war with the ruthless and frighteningly efficient lambs. Unfortunately, as anyone would guess, the lambs were eventually defeated once the cows got involved, ending their violent and hitherto successful conquest. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This defeat left the lambs in a state of chronic depression, as they had to give back all of their enslaved milk pigs. In their desperation, the sheep resorted to trying to eat grass, but to their pleasant surprise, it actually seemed to work. Unfortunately, the biggest baddest lamb died shortly after this discovery due the vast amount of stress caused by the pig milk withdrawal. This obviously allowed another lamb who had been gaining power under the biggest baddest lamb to take over. This lamb had a shockingly white coat of wool, and strongly believed that other lambs should be just like him. Because of this, the whitest lamb, as we shall call him, ordered a violent genocide against sheep with a great enough melanin concentration in their wool. This left the lamb population in the farm the whitest in the land, and since this type of high grade wool was in high demand, the farmer found himself becoming one of the top wool sellers in the country. This of course, is why killing ewes just as they were giving birth turned out to be a highly profitable decision for the farmer. Other sheep keepers, of course, realized this and attempted to try the trick for themselves. However, the results proved impossible to replicate; more often than not, the farmers’ entire sheep population went extinct, leaving the farmers bankrupt. They would then try to accuse our farmer of animal cruelty, but his logic and reasoning ended up being too impeccable for anyone to beat.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the sheep genocide, the whitest sheep figured it would be a mighty good idea if they had another war with all of the other farms. The other lambs thought this was a mighty good idea as well, so the lambs began to swiftly invade every farm in their vicinity once again. This endeavor ended the same way as the last, and the lambs faced another humiliating defeat. In the end of the war, the whitest lamb decided to try and repeatedly stab himself against a rake. However, before this activity could be completed, the girl that would one day become legend saved the whitest lamb. Why Mary was on the sheep farm in the exact place where the whitest lamb intended to rake stab himself, at the exact time that the whitest lamb intended to rake stab himself, still remains a mystery to this day. The farmer, seeing what happened, sheared the whitest lamb one last time and allowed Mary to take it away. He had no use for a suicidal lamb, and he had no desire to slaughter it for it was not an ewe, and it was not giving birth. 
        </p>

            he whitest lamb was quite bitter about this development, as ruthless dictators like himself do not appreciate having their suicides interrupted. Because of this, the lamb swore retribution on Mary. From that point on, wherever Mary went, the lamb was sure to go, in hopes he might make his kill. However, the lamb was weak. In the first lamb war, the whitest lamb was almost killed by a duck, and he hadn’t even bothered to personally participate in the second war. Despite having gotten the opportunity at multiple occasions to push Mary off a cliff or drive her into a raging river, the lamb’s feeble attempts were often brushed off, to his increasing frustration, as signs of affection. The anatomical design of a sheep just wasn’t fit to kill. Four hoofed legs can not grab, choke, or scratch, and in a sheep’s case do not pack enough power to kick. The only real offense a sheep offered was a blunt force headbutt, since the rest of its fluffy body would likely do more to comfort than to hurt. A male sheep would eventually grow thick rounded horns to help with this, but the little lamb did not want to wait. He wanted blood now. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Months passed, but the lamb had no further luck. He had tried many methods of killing multiple times over, but to no avail. Strangeling Mary in her sleep just wouldn’t work out without hands or other appendages for grabbing. Assault, as discussed, wasn’t that effective either as the little lamb didn’t output enough raw force. One day, the little lamb had realized that tool use could be instrumental in his victory, and immediately berserker rushed Mary with a kitchen knife in his mouth. However, this attack was laughable, looking and working as pathetically as one would expect. This routine of assault went on until Mary’s school year began, and the lamb could not work up the courage to follow her into the building where he would have to face hordes of children. The little lamb spent these days wandering around the woods and thinking of ways he could slaughter Mary. He often did this in a melancholic and introspective manner which would have made anyone feel bad if they didn’t know what he was being introspective about. One day, the little lamb found a loaded bear trap lying in the woods. This was huge for the lamb. It packed enough power to kill at least three or four little girls simultaneously, and could be easily dragged to a place where Mary would tread. Brimming with excitement, the lamb brought the bear trap all the way to his barnhouse to prepare for his kill. Today, he resigned, he would march into the schoolhouse and try and force Mary out. It was a rash decision and overall quite dumb, but the lamb had waited far too long and couldn’t bear to wait another moment. The day had come for Mary to finally atone for her sins!
        </p>
        <p>
            It was a normal day of school for Mary and her fellow first graders. The experience was surprisingly similar to what we would expect for first grade to be. The children learned normal first grade things in the normal first grade manner. Friends were made, and mortal enemies formed. Mary was particularly ruthless in destroying her mortal enemies. She had built up a substantial trust factor with the teacher, and this made her the single most feared student in the entire class. If you weren’t lucky enough to be on Mary’s good side, she would mercilessly micromanage you and summon the teacher if you were ever to step even slightly out of line. This may not seem like the greatest problem at first until you realize that Mary lived back in the 1800s. In this type of scenario, instead of getting simply reprimanded or sent out, the first graders would most likely be publicly flogged by the teacher’s fearsome wooden ruler. Over time, numerous blood alliances were formed to try and stop Mary’s ramage, but they were all swiftly reminded of their place in the classroom hierarchy. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In a way, Mary and the little lamb weren’t all that different. Both were up and coming ruthless dictators who indulged in the suffering of their enemies. Neither knew of this of course, although the little lamb did have the perception that Mary was evil. The lamb contemplated this idea, as he almost constantly did, while he stood outside of the school building. In the distance, he could see his old sheep farm under attack by a pack of wolves. The dazzlingly white wool of the farm’s inhabitants made them more noticeable than usual to predators, but the farmer had done an excellent job keeping the wolves and mountain lions out. This was the first wolf attack in a long time, so the farmer was nowhere to be found. There was, however, a boy in the fields crying for help. To the lamb’s confusion, the townspeople living by the farm didn’t come to the boy’s rescue. He watched, perplexed, as the boy was swiftly devoured along with the entire lamb empire. Shaking off his distraction, the lamb marched through the schoolhouse door and towards Mary’s classroom.
        </p>

            Mary was just in the middle of demonstrating her dominance to other students when the small sheep walked into the building looking more pathetic than usual. Making an effort to appear sick and weak, the lamb staggered to Mary’s feet and collapsed. But before Mary could have any discernible reaction to this unexpected turn of events, the teacher was looming over her desk with the wooden ruler. The school had a strict no pets policy, and bringing a farm animal into the building was a particularly punishable infraction. Breaking this rule was far worse than all of the minor infractions Mary had ever brought down justice for combined, and the teacher made sure to make this clear to Mary and all the other students watching. The next interaction between Mary and the teacher’s ruler is far too terrible to record in this story, and is best left forgotten. The teacher, after finishing off Mary, turned to the lamb menacingly. This, combined with the scene he had just witnessed, was enough for the little lamb to dash out of the room and run all the way back home crying for the mother who had been slaughtered during his birth.

            A short while later, Mary appeared back at home. She sat down by the window and stared out in thought for the rest of the day. When night fell, she broke into her father’s alcohol stores and tried a drink. What had happened today was the childhood equivalent of being stabbed 36 times rapidly in the neck, waterboarded, crucified, waterboarded again, getting your toes and fingers cut off with a hacksaw, getting your arms and legs cut off with a hacksaw, and then immediately being shoved into a meat grinder made entirely out of the bones from your amputated limbs. It wasn’t that she had taken such a great beating. She was surprisingly fine about taking the greatest flogging in the history of her school. Her real loss was of her power. Today she had gone from the most feared dictator in the classroom to the lowest of the low. This feeling of loss was too much to bear, and Mary drank and drank and drank all through the night. Mourning for herself, Mary reflected on how she got to where she was at that moment. And she realized that the person, or, rather, the thing, responsible for her suffering was currently resting peacefully in the barn by her house. Intoxicated, bloodthirsty, and filled with manic rage, Mary drew the eight largest kitchen knives she could find and staggered viciously towards her barnhouse. Drunkenly, she kicked open the door, laughing like a person who had just been stabbed 36 times rapidly in the neck, waterboarded, crucified, waterboarded again, gotten their toes and fingers cut off with a hacksaw, gotten their arms and legs cut off with a hacksaw, and then immediately shoved into a meat grinder made entirely out of the bones from their amputated limbs and was about to have vengeance on the person who did all this to them. When Mary raged murderously into the barnhouse, she was seeing red. But it wasn’t because of her anger. The little lamb’s snow white wool was stained red with a spray of blood, and his head had been smashed open by a bear trap. Why the little lamb had chosen to kill himself again is still one of the greatest mysteries of his time. Perhaps his miniscule sheep brain had simply forgotten that the trap was there. More likely, the lamb knew that the sights he saw in the schoolhouse would haunt him for the rest of his life and did not wish to live through it. 
        </p>

            The murderous glow in Mary’s eyes faded away and she lumbered back to her house feeling empty and dejected. Later, Mary would take up animal cruelty as a hobby in attempts to ward off the demons she found herself with on this fateful day. In fact, other famous ditties such as Hickory Dickory Dock were single handedly caused by a manic and tormented Mary. However cruel these acts were, Mary ultimately found joy in her life by torturing and killing small animals. The little lamb’s spirit also came to rest when Mary was finally killed trying to beat a venomous snake to death with her bare hands. After everything, Mary and the Little Lamb did manage dying happily, albeit twistedly, ever after.
