            My name is Owen Le, and I am an Asian American freshman at Summit Shasta. As of the moment, I have no formal accomplishments or published work. This website, made with HTML and CSS, is the first real one I have made.

            In terms of writing, I favor humorous or clever styles. I prefer writing in second person or third person, as they are simply superior to first when it comes to describing things in a clever way. Aside from this, I would like my writing to speak for itself. Mary had a Little Lamb is my latest short story, and can be found in the My Work section of this website.
